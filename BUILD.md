## Build Instructions

Build type: manual

1. Ensure `minesweeper-2eb09` directory doesn't exist, delete including content if it does
1. Create a new directory `minesweeper-2eb09` (`2eb09` comes from the MD5 hash of `"minesweeper"` and is there to prevent name collisions)
1. Copy `../entities/`, `../maps/`, and `../music/` directories (with content) to `minesweeper-2eb09`
1. Copy `../extra_english.lang`, `../customstory.png`, `../custom_story_settings.cfg`, and `../LICENSE` files into `minesweeper-2eb09`
1. If 7zip is available on the system, archive `minesweeper-2eb09` into a `amnesia-minesweeper-2eb09.7zip`
